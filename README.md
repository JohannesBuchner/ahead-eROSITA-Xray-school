# Statistical Aspects of X-ray Spectral Analysis, exercises & code

Welcome!

Here you can find all code used in the exercises, plots and analysis of the "Spectral Aspects of X-ray Spectral Analysis" textbook chapter for
the Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astronomy, Section XVI.

Still under development, but for each directory we plan to add a solution in PyXspec and/or Sherpa to each exercise.
